    <p>I am a software developer, recently graduated with Bachelor in Computer Science. C is my favorite language. I also like
      Python, C++, and Lua.You can find my latest projects on github.
    </p>
    <p>I have a cat and a dog. I'm not on any social media but I'm a social person.</p>
    <p>I believe it is our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the Earth.</p>
    <p>I like to read books. Recently I completed 1984 by G. Orwell and Cosmos by Carl Sagan.</p>
    <p>I admire Carl Sagan a lot. He has given me wisdom, knowledge and understanding, to have a sceptical mind and to lessen
      the suffering of others.</p>
